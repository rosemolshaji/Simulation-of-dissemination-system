# Simulation of Multi-Tier Genetic Dissemination System

## Overview

This repository contains an R-based Monte Carlo simulation framework for modelling multi-tier genetic dissemination systems in aquaculture breeding programs.

The model evaluates biological uncertainty and production outcomes across:

- Tier 2 (Multiplier)
- Tier 3 (Hatchery)
- Tier 4 (Production)

---

## Model Features

The framework integrates:

- Beta-distributed biological parameters  
- Survival and fecundity scenarios  
- Genetic gain assumptions  
- Descriptive statistics  
- Visualisation of simulation outputs  

---

## How to Run

In R:

```r
source("R/run_all.R")
